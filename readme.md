# Turnkey
Skip the set up - jump into the fun stuff!

## What is it?
### Turnkey is a boilerplate, which creates...
* A React app with components for login, signup, and protected pages
* An Express server using models, routes, and controllers (opinionated architecture for life!)
* A PostgreSQL database to store user signups

### Authentication? Turnkey's got you covered.
Turnkey stores hashed passwords using bcrypt and uses JSON Web Tokens to authenticate users.


## How do I use it?
1. Clone this repo
2. Install Node.JS if necessary
3. In the cloned repo run `sh init.sh`
4. Designate a project and database name
5. Start coding!
